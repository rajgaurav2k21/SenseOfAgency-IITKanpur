**Experiment: Sense of Agency in VR**

**Task**: The target ball moves along a figure-eight track (600 mm high, 300 mm wide) at 235.5 mm/s. Each trial involves 4 circles, each taking 8 seconds.

**Conditions**:
1. **Baseline**: Gray ball in VR mimics hand movements exactly.
2. **Non-Intervention**: Gray ball mimics hand movements; participants wear a 1-kg wrist weight.
3. **Intervention**: Gray ball movement is a 50/50 mix of hand and target ball movements; participants wear a 1-kg wrist weight.

**Procedure**:
- **Trials**: 9 total (3 per condition).
- **Order**: Alternating ABABAB for intervention/non-intervention; baseline last.
- **Blind Conditions**: Participants unaware of condition changes to ensure genuine responses.

**Participant Feedback**:
- **Control Rating**: After each trial, participants rate their sense of control from 1 to 7.

**Findings**:
- **Sense of Agency**: Control was highest in baseline. The 1-kg weight reduced control, but the visual guide restored it.
- **Movement Accuracy**: Accuracy was consistent across all conditions, unaffected by the weight or visual guide.
